### üëã Hi there

I'm **Daniel Pinto**, a software engineer and co-founder of **Magma Ventures**, where I lead the design and development of enterprise-grade digital solutions. I bring over 4 years of experience managing full-cycle software projects ‚Äî from technical planning and system architecture to development, delivery, and iteration.

I specialize in building full-stack web platforms, scalable backends, modern mobile apps, and technical ecosystems tailored for businesses in sectors like **sustainability**, **climate tech**, and **commerce**. My work often involves solving complex problems at the intersection of technology, data, and business operations.

As a team leader, I‚Äôve driven the successful implementation of high-impact platforms, such as:

* **Custom ERP systems** for managing climate action projects, integrating modules for project tracking, regulatory compliance, and impact monitoring.
* **Greenhouse Gas Emissions Quantification Tools**, used to calculate, monitor, and report carbon footprints based on ISO methodologies and climate standards.
* **Client relationship and workflow platforms** designed to manage multi-stakeholder processes, automate reporting, and track service delivery in consulting contexts.
* **Commerce and service platforms** with tailored interfaces and dashboards for internal teams and clients, combining performance with usability.

I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams, translating business needs into well-engineered systems, and continuously improving processes using modern tech stacks and development best practices.

### üöÄ Expertise

I have extensive experience leading multidisciplinary software teams, where I combine technical execution with strategic thinking. My role often bridges the gap between engineering and business: identifying product needs, designing robust system architectures, and ensuring scalable and maintainable codebases.

My work spans the full stack. On the frontend, I build modern, responsive user interfaces using frameworks like Vue 3 and React, with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS to enhance performance and maintainability. I place strong emphasis on user experience and clean component-based design.

On the backend, I‚Äôve architected complex APIs and microservices using Django REST Framework, FastAPI, and Laravel ‚Äî with PostgreSQL and MySQL as reliable data layers. My applications often include authentication, permissions, task queues, and third-party integrations. I also work with data pipelines and climate datasets, applying logic to quantify emissions and track environmental indicators.

For mobile solutions, I use Flutter to build cross-platform apps, delivering native-like performance with a shared codebase. These apps often complement web systems or provide tailored field-user experiences.

In DevOps and infrastructure, I rely on Docker for containerization, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, and tools like Nginx and Dokku to ensure reliable deployment pipelines ‚Äî whether on cloud platforms like DigitalOcean or custom environments.

I also value clear documentation, collaborative workflows, and agile practices, ensuring that projects move efficiently from idea to release ‚Äî and scale reliably post-launch.
