# üëã Hello, I'm Daniel Pinto

I‚Äôm a **full-stack developer** and co-founder of **Magma Ventures**, where I lead the core software team in building impactful digital products. With over **4 years of experience** in enterprise-level development, I focus on delivering robust, scalable, and user-centric systems ‚Äî especially for industries like **sustainability**, **climate tech**, and **commerce**.

I specialize in designing and leading full-cycle software projects ‚Äî from architecture to deployment ‚Äî including:

- üß© **Custom ERP systems** for managing climate action programs, compliance workflows, and project reporting  
- üå± **Carbon emission quantification platforms** based on ISO and GHG Protocol standards  
- ü§ù **Client relationship ecosystems** that integrate project tracking, team coordination, and service delivery  
- üõí **Digital commerce platforms** optimized for usability, performance, and scalable growth  

I thrive at the intersection of technology and business ‚Äî translating real-world challenges into elegant, maintainable software.

## üöÄ Expertise

I lead **multidisciplinary software teams** and work across the entire product lifecycle ‚Äî from discovery and system design to hands-on development and release.

My frontend work focuses on building **modern UIs** using **Vue 3**, **React**, and **TypeScript**, with an emphasis on component design, accessibility, and performance. I use **Tailwind CSS** and **Vite** to streamline styling and builds.

On the backend, I architect secure and modular APIs with **Django REST Framework**, **FastAPI**, and **Laravel**, backed by relational databases like **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, and **SQLite**. These systems often include **background tasks**, **auth systems**, **OpenAPI docs**, and deep integration with third-party services.

For **mobile apps**, I use **Flutter** and **Dart** to ship responsive, native-quality experiences ‚Äî often connected to backend platforms for real-time data and user interaction.

In **DevOps**, I leverage tools like **Docker**, **GitHub Actions**, and **Nginx** to deliver consistent and reliable deployments. I frequently deploy on **DigitalOcean**, using **Dokku** to manage infrastructure with minimal overhead.

I‚Äôm also experienced in:
- Working with **climate and sustainability datasets**
- Building tools for **data collection** and **field research** (e.g. **ODK**, **Power BI**)
- Maintaining high-quality **documentation**, **agile workflows**, and **CI/CD pipelines**
